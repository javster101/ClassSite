        <h2>Our course offerings</h2>

        For both the introductory and high school paths, we offer half-day and full-day courses. The half-day course consists of the learning portion of the day, 
        which involves learning the key aspects of the day's concepts, and expanding that concept through exercises and examples. 
         <br><br>
        The full-day course is the complete experience, allowing the first half's learning to be applied to exciting and insightful projects
        to solidify and gain insight into the importance of the lesson. In addition, students will have support from our expert teachers 
        and TAs while working on their projects. This allows them to have ambitious and rewarding projects while not feeling overwhelmed.
        <br><br>
        Please contact us with any queries about lessons plans, course recommendations, etc.

            <h2>High School/AP Computer Science</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Planning on taking high school/AP computer science? This is the right path for you! We go through the critical parts of the College Board AP Computer 
              Science curriculum and develop cornerstone knowledge in Java, the industry leading programming language. Through this process, we grow your student's understanding of programming,
              both practically and theoretically. We will use AP Exam practice material to create an authentic learning experience that matches high school CS education closely. 
              We will also take diagnostic tests at the start and end of the week to help give a metric of growth for the student.
              <hr>  This course is applicable to students in 8-12th grade that are planning on taking
               high school computer science, especially those interested in the AP exam. Student with experience in Java will get independent attention to accelerate their knowledge through advanced problems & tips.
                Younger students with previous programming experience may join as well!</p><hr>
